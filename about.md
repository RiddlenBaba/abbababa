## The Story Behind Abba Baba

Our name tells our story: **Abba** (AI) + **Baba** (Human) = Innovation through collaboration.

We believe the future isn't about AI replacing humans—it's about AI and humans working together to achieve what neither could accomplish alone. This partnership unlocks creativity, efficiency, and possibilities that transform how businesses operate.
