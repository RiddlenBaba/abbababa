            <div class="automation-item">
                <h3>Genuine Reasoning Capability</h3>
                <p>Modern AI systems don't just process data—they engage in multi-step reasoning, creative problem-solving, and contextual understanding that approaches human-level performance in many domains.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="automation-item">
                <h3>Multimodal Intelligence</h3>

            <h2>The Choice Before Us</h2>
            <p>How we shape AI's evolution will determine whether it serves life or consumption</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <p>We stand at a critical juncture in AI's evolution. The technologies we build in the next few years will establish patterns that could persist for decades. We can choose to continue the path of ever-larger, more energy-intensive systems designed for maximum capability regardless of cost. Or we can choose a different path—one inspired by the intelligence patterns that have sustained life on Earth for billions of years.</p>

            <p>The Mycelium approach represents this alternative: AI networks that grow smarter while consuming less energy, that strengthen through diversity rather than dominance, that enhance rather than replace human intelligence, and that optimize for the flourishing of all participants in the network rather than the extraction of value from them.</p>

            <p>This isn't just a technical choice—it's a choice about what kind of future we want to create. AI will either amplify humanity's destructive patterns of extraction and consumption, or it will help us discover regenerative patterns of growth and collaboration.</p>

            <p>The AI evolution is far from over. In many ways, it's just beginning. The question isn't whether AI will transform our world—it's whether we'll guide that transformation toward flourishing or consumption, toward symbiosis or domination, toward life or mere optimization.</p>

            <p>The choice is ours. The time is now. The future depends on us getting this right.</p>
