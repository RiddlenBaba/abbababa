## Getting Started

### What is Abba Baba?
Abba Baba is a pioneering AI-human collaboration company that builds intelligent automation solutions. We specialize in workflow automation, marketing automation, AI integration consulting, and our flagship Riddlen platform that combines AI generation with human validation.

### How does AI-human collaboration work?
Our approach enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them. AI handles repetitive tasks and data processing, while humans provide creative thinking, decision-making, and validation. This partnership delivers better results than either could achieve alone.

### What makes you different from other automation companies?
We focus on human-centric AI that preserves agency and decision-making. Our solutions are designed to free your time for high-value work, not eliminate jobs. Plus, we offer end-to-end support from strategy to implementation.
