## Technical Notes for Claude

### Security & Privacy Guidelines
**CRITICAL: DO NOT READ OR ACCESS PRIVATE FILES**
- Never read `_config.private.yml` - contains sensitive API keys
- Never read any files matching `*.private.*` pattern
- Never access `.env` files or similar private configuration
- Never display, copy, or provide actual API key values
- Never include real API keys in documentation or instructions
- If you need to reference private config structure, refer to the setup documentation instead
- Respect gitignored files - they are private for security reasons
- ALWAYS use placeholders like [Your API Key] instead of actual keys
- Direct users to get keys from their local files, never provide them

### When Working on This Project
1. **Maintain brand voice**: Professional, innovative, human-centric
2. **Focus on benefits**: Always translate features to user value
3. **Keep it clean**: Avoid over-complicating the design or copy
4. **Mobile-first**: Ensure responsive design in all additions
5. **Performance matters**: Optimize everything for fast loading
6. **Clear CTAs**: Every page should guide users to action
7. **SEO awareness**: Use semantic HTML, proper headings, meta descriptions
8. **Security first**: Never expose or log sensitive information

### File Organization
- Keep layouts modular and reusable
- Use includes for repeated elements (header, footer, CTA sections)
- Organize assets logically (images by section, etc.)
- Comment code for future maintainability

### Configuration Priorities
- Set up proper baseurl for GitHub Pages
- Configure SEO plugin if using one
- Set up analytics (Google Analytics or alternative)
- Enable contact form (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or similar)
