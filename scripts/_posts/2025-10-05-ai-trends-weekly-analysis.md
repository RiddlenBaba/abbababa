## Deep Dive: Understanding the Innovation

Ryan sits down with Marco Palladino, CTO of Kong, to talk about the rise of AI agents and their impact on API consumption, the MCP protocol as a new standard for agents, the importance of observability and security in AI systems, and the importance for businesses and entrepreneurs to leverage opportunities in the agentic AI space now....

### Why This Matters Now

The convergence of factors driving this development creates a unique window of opportunity:

- **Market Timing**: Early adoption phase offers maximum competitive differentiation
- **Technology Maturity**: Sufficient development for reliable business implementation
- **Resource Accessibility**: Implementation barriers lower than ever before
- **Competitive Landscape**: Limited widespread adoption creates first-mover advantages

### The Broader Context

This innovation doesn't exist in isolation. It's part of a larger transformation where AI capabilities are becoming foundational business infrastructure rather than experimental add-ons.

## Strategic Business Implications

### Immediate Opportunities
